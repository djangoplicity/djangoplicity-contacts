This directory is meant to store static files that need to be processed such
as original images to convert to sprites, SCSS files that will be converted
to CSS, etc.

SCSS
====
SCSS is a CSS extension which makes writing CSS files much easier. It supports
variables, inheritance, etc.
More info at:
http://sass-lang.com/

The .scss files are stored in src/djangoplicity-contacts/components/scss/

During development run the following command to automatically rebuild the
output css file:

sass --watch  components/scss/review.scss:src/djangoplicity/contacts/static/css/review.css

Both the input scss and the output css files should be commited to the
repository.

ReactJS
=======
We use NPM to compile the reactJS files into a single js output:

cd components/npm/
webpack -w
